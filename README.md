## Finding the perfect dog 

1. Gathering data from Kaggle
2. Webscraping to get addtional information not availble in dataset
3. Cleaning data 
4. Combining datasets 
5. Data Visualisation and EDA
6. Final result is 3 dog breeds to choose from 

## Requirements for the dog 

- Looking in the price range of 1800 USD
- As I am very actice, I would love a dog that fits under that category 
- Medium size dog around 50cm in height 
- I would love to learn my dog tricks and train it, so definitely looking for an intelligent dog 
- Long life expectancy as I am young and want my best furry friend for as long as possible  
- Personality wise I would love a loyal dog
- I am also hoping to find an active dog that wants to do long hikes and go on runs
